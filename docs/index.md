## Managing Translational Informatics Projects (MTIP)

**When**: 
March 25, 2019 

**Time**: 
9am - 5pm Central (with a break for non-hosted lunch)  

**Where**: 
Northwestern University Chicago campus
Rubloff Building, 375 E Chicago Ave. - Lakeview Conference Room, 11th floor
Chicago, IL 60611 ([campus map](https://maps.northwestern.edu/facility/30)). In person space is limited to 15-18 so registration is required. Remote participation info will be sent to registrants.


Translational Informatics projects are increasingly cross-institutional and even international; managing them comes with lots of shared pain points. This one day workshop will provide hands-on training to anyone who is organizing or managing cross-functional distributed teams that develop code or that analyze data across the translational divide*. Specifically, we will introduce several the practical tools and techniques for managers to facilitate these kinds of endeavors. The hands-on training will familiarize participants with helpful tools and techniques, and to help them make informed decisions about which tools might work best for their particular contexts. We conclude with a session wherein all participants are welcome to share additional pain points and related experience.

**Who should attend**: Open to anyone; priority will be given to Informatics program, and project managers, as well as PIs that may function in this role. 

**Prerequisites**: No prior knowledge of any of the tools is required, and participation in any or all of the modules is warmly welcome.  

**Cost**: Free to attend

Note that if the workshop is oversubscribed, a second date will be considered. Members of CTSA institutions will be prioritized.

#### Invitation
We are -- all of us -- continually learning. Road-tested lessons learned and strategies will be taught, but if there is a newer, better, more scaleable way of doing something operational, we really want to know so we can have more time to focus on the science. Speak up; we would love to hear.
