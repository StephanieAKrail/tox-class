# Final Group Presentation Assignment

# Assignment overview

This assignment is a student group study followed by presentations to the rest of the class. The assignment is designed to maximize active and collaborative roles for each participant.

Each group of students must choose a topic and have it approved by the course instructor. The topics may be deeper dives on previously discussed debate or class topics or a new topic. Topics should be about a controversial topic or a recent discovery in environmental health. Environmental health here is inclusive of both human and ecosystem health. 

The assignment will be to identify one primary manuscript, and do some background investigation regarding what accessory information led to the work or was the outcomes of it. This may include prior cited works, contradictory works, news articles, new policies, datasets, blogs, and other content that provides the background information or translational impact. 

The student group should create a markdown Github page for their "reading list" for the class to review in advance. Accessory files for review can be uploaded into Github for review as needed, or simply linked on the markdown page. This reading list should be posted on the Friday before the presentation is scheduled. 

There will be four groups scheduled for the weeks of 5/29 and 6/5.

The goal of the presentations are to not only consider a timely and/or interesting recent topic in environmental health, but also to discuss and consider the following aspects to the topic:

1. Can you tell who did what? 
2. What resources were used in the work and were they attributed? C
3. an you follow the provenance chain? Can you get to the primary data?
4. Who funded the work, and any dependent resources? Do you think this could have led to any bias?
5. Is there confounding evidence, and do you support the current conclusions, and why?

# Goals
Use presentation skills to formulate an "elevator speech" to use in networking and professional activities
Engage in active group-based learning
Become more familiar with collaborative web-based tools 
Gain leadership and organizational experience
Increase evidence-based thought processes and conclusion drawing

## Participants in the Class

### Master of Class (MC). 
Sets the tone and pace by introducing the topic and speakers. Introductions are mini-speeches. Introduce the speakers to the audience and the audience to the speaker to establish mutuality—a common bond.

Introduction: Make audience aware of the importance of the topic. Explains why "this subject.
Explain that there will be a question/answer period after each talk followed by a general discussion period at the end of both talks.
Conclusion……that leads to the actual talk.
Also responsible for managing the timing of the presentations and discussion. Keeps the pace by keeping everyone, including evaluators (and yourself!), on time. Communicates with the speakers and Lead Evaluator.

### Presenter 1. 
10 min. Introduces the topic including a concise background of the topic, perspectives and relevance. Include any special methods, terminology needed to understand the papers.

5 min Q&A, then brief (5 min or less) pause while everyone fills out evaluations on Presenter 1.

### Presenter 2. 
10 min. Summarizes the findings reported in the paper, methods and conclusions.

5 min Q&A, then brief (5 min or less) pause while everyone fills out evaluations on Presenter 2, makes any adjustments on evaluations for Presentor 1. 

### Discussion Leader (DL). 
MC turns over class to DL once papers are presented. DL invites questions from audience and also has 3 ideas to discuss (these are posted before class) in case discussion has a hard time. 
Look first to the students who were not presenting for answers to any questions.
