##### [Back to Home](../index.md)

### Overview


#### 1) Download Zoom (video on please)

We will be screensharing over Zoom for remote participants so please [install it](https://zoom.us/download) on your computer if you haven't already. You may also join the Zoom if you are participating in person, however in this case please remain completely _off audio_ (note that this is different from just being on mute). 

Let's face it: avideo conference is hard. It will be more fun if it is as lively and interactive as possible, so please participate with video on, at least when you are talking, unless you have bandwidth constraints.

#### 2) Make sure you have a computer to use

You will learn best if you are actively applying the skills rather than just observing them.

#### 3) Join the team and chatroom

- You will first need a GitHub account if you don't already have one; it is absolutely free at [github.com/join](https://github.com/join). 
- Then go to the the public tutorial Chat room [on Gitter here](https://gitter.im/tis-lab/MTIP-tutorial?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) and sign in with GitHub
- I will then invite each to the MTIP tutorial team on GitHub. Membership in the team will give you the credentials you will need to complete the exercises. **To accept membership in the team,go to [github.com/data2health](http://github.com/data2health) and click the blue invitation banner at the top.**

#### 4) Share (or just bring) your use case

Do you have a particular concrete problem you are hoping the MTIP training will help you solve? If so, are you willing to have the class screenshare as we strategize a custom approach for you? If the answer is "yes yes", please email data2health+mtip@gmail.com asap so that we can queue it up. 

If you have a specific use case, but *don't* want to share it with the class, that's ok. However, consider bringing your documents/project milestones/data/calendar/team roster or whatever to work on. Synthetic use cases will also be available if you prefer.
